# Scraping Netflix - The Unofficial Way!
A Python class that scrapes information about Netflix movies that are available for streaming. Used by [www.tomatoflix.com][1]

# Why? 
This project started because I wanted to create [Tomatoflix][1], an interactive website that helps lazy people like me find random Netflix movies to watch.
I was surprised to find out that Netflix privatized their API. I took matters into my own hands and decided to forge a Netflix API of my own.

# Requirements
* Python 3
* Modules: 
    * BeautifulSoup
    * Requests
    * Fuzzywuzzy (Not very impressed with this one... Open to fuzzy matching alternatives. But it'll do for now.)

# Installation
Git clone this to your local computer and it should be good to go.
Currently working on making this installable via Pip.

# Instructions
```python
from netflix import *

# Insert netflix ID as a raw string
# To find Netflix ID:
# Sign into Netflix > Chrome Developer Tools > Resources > Cookies > www.netflix.com > NetflixId
netflix_id = r'INSERT NETFLIX ID HERE'

movie = Netflix(netflix_id)

# Initialization only has to be done once.
# This method creates jsons for all of the major genres that will be used to pull data from
movie.initialize()

"""
>Genres were successfully downloaded as JSON files
"""

# search() looks to see if the movie is available on Netflix streaming.
# other methods are chained to search() and returns specific information about the movie.
movie.search('Jerry Maguire').duration()
movie.search('Jerry Maguire').netflix_rating()

"""
>Movie was found
>2hr 18m
>3.6 stars
"""
```
